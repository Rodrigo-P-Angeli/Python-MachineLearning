# Titanic Survived Prediction with DT-and-RF

 Developed by [Rodrigo Pissinate De Angeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-pissinate-de-angeli-13785b118/?locale=en_US). This is a attempt to see what happens when we use Decision Tree and Random Forest in the famous Titanic Survived Data Sets. We have also used diferents Methods on the same data to see which one give us better results. 
 
 - [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-KNN)
 - [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-SVM)
 - [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-DNN)
 - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression)
 
 Since this attempt was only to compare the methods, I was not worried to comment all the code. So do not hesitate to contact me if you have any doubts.
 
# Getting Started
- Download the [test](titanic_test.csv) and [train](titanic_train.csv) data, **Put it on a new folder**.
- Download the [Python code](DT-and-RF-for-Titanic-Survived-Predic.ipynb), **Put it on the same folder**.
- Make sure you have all **Libaries** required installed:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
- **Run Jupyter Notebook and Run all lines of code**

# Motivation
- In today's world, data analysis and machine learning are increasingly present. Those who do not know or do not understand the subject will be out of step in the job market, no matter what area you dealing with, biomedical, engineering, IT, etc. So I decided to learn more about it.
- The analyzes were done in Python - Anaconda, using the Jupyter notebook as it is easier to understand and visualize during the study.
