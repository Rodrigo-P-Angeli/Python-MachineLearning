# Deep Learning Tensorflow Project

 Developed by [Rodrigo Pissinate De Angeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-pissinate-de-angeli-13785b118/?locale=en_US) as a Machine Learning project in order to learn more about Deep Learning Tensorflow using Jupyter Notebook.

 This is a Tensorflow Project for the section "Deep Learning" in the [Machine Learning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/). The basic idea of this project is to identify if the bank note is True or Flase using Deep Leaning method.
 
# Getting Started
- Download the [data sets](bank_note_data.csv) for this Project, **Put it on a new folder**.
- Download the [Python code](04-Tensorflow-Project-Exercise.ipynb), **Put it on the same folder**.
- Make sure you have all **Libaries** required installed:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
  - Tensorflow - Some versions may use different objects
- **Run Jupyter Notebook and Run all lines of code**

# Motivation
- In today's world, data analysis and machine learning are increasingly present. Those who do not know or do not understand the subject will be out of step in the job market, no matter what area you dealing with, biomedical, engineering, IT, etc. So I decided to take the course and learn about the subjects.
- The analyzes were done in Python - Anaconda, using the Jupyter notebook as it is easier to understand and visualize during the study.
