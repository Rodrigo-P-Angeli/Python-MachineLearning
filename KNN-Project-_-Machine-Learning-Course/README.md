# KNN Project _ Machine Learning Course
 
 Developed by [Rodrigo Pissinate De Angeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-pissinate-de-angeli-13785b118/?locale=en_US) as a Machine Learning project in order to learn more about KNN Classification Method using Jupyter Notebook.

 This a Project in the [Machine Learning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).
 
 For this project we will be exploring a data provided by the course. And we choose the best value of K with the Elbow method.
 
# Getting Started
- Download the [data sets](KNN_Project_Data) for this Project, **Put it on a new folder**.
- Download the [Python code](02-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb), **Put it on the same folder**.
- Make sure you have all **Libaries** required installed:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
- **Run Jupyter Notebook and Run all lines of code**

# Motivation
- In today's world, data analysis and machine learning are increasingly present. Those who do not know or do not understand the subject will be out of step in the job market, no matter what area you dealing with, biomedical, engineering, IT, etc. So I decided to take the course and learn about the subjects.
- The analyzes were done in Python - Anaconda, using the Jupyter notebook as it is easier to understand and visualize during the study.
