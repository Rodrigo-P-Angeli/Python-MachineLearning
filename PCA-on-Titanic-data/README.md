# PCA on Titanic data

 Developed by [Rodrigo Pissinate De Angeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-pissinate-de-angeli-13785b118/?locale=en_US). This is a attempt to organize better the variables presented on the Titanic data Sets to try to understand why none of the Machine Learning listed below provided a good result. 
 
 - [K Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-KNN)
 - [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-SVM)
 - [Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-DNN)
 - [Random Forest and Decision Tree](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-DT-and-RF)
 - [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Rodrigo-P-Angeli/Titanic-Survived-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression)
 
After the analysis we were able to identify and plot all variables into 2 and 3 Principal Components (2D and 3D Plots). Also we could identify that none were capable to cluster very well the data. So I concluded to get a better prediction I must have a better data cleaning and analysis and the different methods in this case will only provide us low percentage of improvement
 
# Getting Started
- Download the [test](titanic_test.csv) and [train](titanic_train.csv) data, **Put it on a new folder**.
- Download the [Python code](PCA%20on%20Titanic%20Data.ipynb), **Put it on the same folder**.
- Make sure you have all **Libaries** required installed:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Sklearn
- **Run Jupyter Notebook and Run all lines of code**

# Motivation
- In today's world, data analysis and machine learning are increasingly present. Those who do not know or do not understand the subject will be out of step in the job market, no matter what area you dealing with, biomedical, engineering, IT, etc. So I decided to learn more about it.
- The analyzes were done in Python - Anaconda, using the Jupyter notebook as it is easier to understand and visualize during the study.
